abstract = {Sparse grids allow one to employ grid-based discretization methods in data-driven problems. We present an extension of the classical sparse grid approach that allows us to tackle high-dimensional problems by spatially adaptive refinement, modified ansatz functions, and efficient regularization techniques. The competitiveness of this method is shown for typical benchmark problems with up to 166 dimensions for classification in data mining, pointing out properties of sparse grids in this context. To gain insight into the adaptive refinement and to examine the scope for further improvements, the approximation of non-smooth indicator functions with adaptive sparse grids has been studied as a model problem. As an example for an improved adaptive grid refinement, we present results for an edge-detection strategy.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present a time-explicit sparse grid discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the three-dimensional time-domain Maxwell equations. The conservation properties and convergence rates are established for different choices of numerical fluxes. The convergence rates are proved theoretically and then verified by several numerical examples. Even though our scheme does not preserve the divergence, but by implying the higher order polynomial, one can observe the same convergence rate as numerical solution. Several numerical tests are presented to validate these conclusions.}
